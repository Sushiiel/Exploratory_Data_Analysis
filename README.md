# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for [Project Name], aimed at understanding the key patterns, trends, and relationships within the dataset. This analysis includes data visualization, summary statistics, and initial findings that can guide further data processing or modeling.

## Project Structure

- **EDA.ipynb**: The main Jupyter notebook that includes all analysis, visualizations, and code explanations.
- **README.md**: Overview of the project, guiding users through the contents and goals of the analysis.
- **data/**: (Optional) Directory to store raw and processed data files if needed for further steps.
- **images/**: (Optional) Directory for saving figures or charts generated during the EDA.

## Key Objectives

1. **Data Understanding**: Explore the dataset to comprehend the structure, attributes, and data types.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies for a cleaner dataset.
3. **Univariate Analysis**: Study each variable individually through summary statistics and distribution plots.
4. **Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis**: Investigate relationships between features using correlation matrices, scatter plots, and other techniques.
5. **Key Insights**: Document observations and findings to support decision-making or further analysis.
